If you sroll down in Re-vents, you'll see inifite scroll pagination is used. Social logins are available as well. If you login in, you can view different events and you'll get a detail page of each event. You also have the ability to join events as well and appear on the attendee list. All of that is live data. Events are hooked up to google maps, so you can see the exact location. You can also comment and reply to comments. Users can update their profile, drag and drop profile photos as well. Of course you can also create your own events. There is recent activity section, that shows you all the recents changes made.
